1. Annotate the condition grammar with JTB. 

java -jar jtb132.jar -p org.andwellness.grammar -o condition-grammar.jtb /Users/selsky/projects/cens/git/AndWellnessConfigValidator/spec/condition-grammar.jj

2. Compile the annotated grammar with JavaCC. (use --DEBUG_PARSER to annotate generated classes with debug messages)

../javacc-5.0/bin/javacc condition-grammar.jtb 

3. Compile the generated Java classes.

javac *java syntaxtree/*java visitor/*java

4. Move the compiled classes to the correct packages. (JavaCC won't do this for you unfortunately.)

5. Now you are ready to extend the created classes. All of the additions for AndWellness are in the org.andwellness.grammar.custom package.
