Welcome to the AndWellnessConfigValidator repository!

Two software artifacts may be generated from this repo. 
1. andwellness-condition-parser-$version.jar (Condition validation, syntax tree, and tree visitors)
2. andwellness-config-validator-$version.jar (Configuration file validation)

The condition parser jar can be used by any app that needs to parse and validate prompt conditions. 
org.andwellness.grammar.parser.ConditionParser is the main driver class. All of the classes in this jar are generated by JTB and JavaCC.

The configuration validator jar is executable and can be used from the command-line or by client code. The jar contains all necessary
dependencies. Run java -jar andwellness-config-validator.jar $filename to validate configuration files. Take a look at
org.andwellness.test.TestConfigValidator for an example of how to validate multiple files.

build.xml builds the configuration validator: ant clean dist
build-parser-jar.xml builds the condition parser: ant clean dist -f build-parser-jar.xml
